			Driver2.java
Define the class InvalidSideException, which inherits from the 
Exception class. Also define a Square class, which has one method 
variable -- an int describing the side length. The constructor of 
the Square class should take one argument, an int meant to 
initialize the side length; however, if the argument is not greater 
than 0, the constructor should throw an InvalidSideError. The
Square class should also have a method getArea(), which returns 
the area of the square.

Create a Driver class with a main method to test your classes. Your 
program should prompt the user to enter a value for the side length, 
and then create a Square object with that side length. If the side 
length is valid, the program should print the area of the square. 
Otherwise, it should catch the InvalidExceptionError, print "Side 
length must be greater than 0.", and terminate the program.
