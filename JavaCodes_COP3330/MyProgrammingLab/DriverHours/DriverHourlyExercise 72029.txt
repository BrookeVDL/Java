				DriverHourly.java
		
Create an HourlyEmployee class that inherits from Employee and has 
two new instance variables: hours, which represents the hours worked, 
and wage, which represents the employee's pay per hour. (Both are doubles.) 
Create a constructor that takes the arguments first name, last name, social 
security number, hourly wage, and the number of hours worked. Also create 
accessors, mutators, an earnings method that returns the money earned by 
the employee this week, and a toString method that returns information about 
the employee in the form of a String. The setWage method should ensure that 
the wage is nonnegative, and the setHours method should ensure that the value 
of hours is between 0 and 168 (the number of hours in a week).

Create a Driver class with a main method that prompts the user to enter a first 
name, last name, social security number, hours, and wage for an employee. Then, 
the program should create an HourlyEmployee object and use its toString method to 
print information about it.
