			Driver.java
Create a class Rectangle with double attributes length and width. 
The default constructor should set these attributes to 1. Provide 
methods that calculate the rectangle's perimeter and area, as well 
as accessors and mutators for both data fields. The mutator methods 
for length and width should verify that the number being passed in 
is larger than 0.0 and less than 20.0 -- if it doesn't fit those criteria, 
the value of the field should not be changed.

Write a Driver class in the same file to test your Rectangle class. It 
should prompt the user to enter a length and width of a rectangle, and then 
print out the area and perimeter of the rectangle. (Use the mutators to set
the length and width of the rectangle, not the constructor.)
