			DuplicateElimination
Write an application that inputs five numbers, each between 10 and 100, 
inclusive. As each number is read, display it only if it’s not a duplicate 
of a number already read. Provide for the “worst case,” in which all five 
numbers are different. Use the smallest possible array to solve this problem. 
Display the complete set of unique values input after the user enters each new 
value.
